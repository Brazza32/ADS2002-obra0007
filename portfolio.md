Portfolio for Semester

Week 2

During Week 2 we began the project by getting our groups and then having a discussion with our project mentor to get more details about the project. One of the tasks that I completed during this week was taking down an extensive set of notes during the discussion with our project manager. This included noting down important programs and progressions that we can undertake during our project that will lead us to our end goal of building a successful model. To help our communication and overall coordination of the project we have set up multiple group chats and avenues to contact each other and the group mentors/lecturers in case we need support during the project. This is over multiple platforms and all group members are in all the groups. We also set up the Github repository that we will use throughout the project and set up our individual branches that we will use once we start coding. As we have not received our data yet we have not developed any code or figures related to the project. I was able to do some initial research into some of the programs that we may use during the semester but I was unable to narrow it down to where to start moving forward.

Week 3 

Week 3 was really the start of the project. The main task this week from the group, mainly led by me, was to try and find a way to get all our data and make it accessible and usable. We encountered a few issues surrounding the data as it was so large and there were a few file corruptions that led to us spending a lot of the class and our time together figuring out ways to extract our data. This was also the main communication during the week as well as setting up the basis of the report and presentation. By having the outline of these set up early, we as a group can chip away slowly over the semester rather than having lots of work in separate places. We also decided on a group leader who would be in charge of commits to code and that was me which will be an exciting but challenging role across the semester. I was also able to give the weekly stand up which is something that I think I will continue to do more across the semester. As we still didnâ€™t fully have our data there was minimal code that was completed but I completed some further research into Tensorflow and how it will work for our project and I believe it will be one of the most important things we work with throughout the semester.

Week 4

Week 4 was when we began to pivot from research and theory and attempt to begin the coding process which we know will be tough and span over most of the semester. I started by conducting some initial research into how we would be able to implement tensorflow and what requirements we would need. This research yielded the fact that all the images should be the same size when imported. This helps the model because it works off sizing and the pixels of the images so ensuring they are the same size is what makes the model work. Once we started working with the data we were able to do some initial analysis into some basic descriptive statistics. I was able to find that for both ETT and NGT catheters that they were placed normally 85.6% of the time. This figure decreased with only 64.7% of CVC catheters placed normally. These initial statistics will help give us a rough idea of what we can expect when we are building a model. I was also able to coordinate and deliver the weekly stand up. This was slightly difficult as I had to get everyone's contribution and some people doubled up on what was done which is poor leadership on my behalf.
